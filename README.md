The error you're encountering is because the Graphviz executables (e.g., dot) are not found in your system's PATH. The diagrams library depends on Graphviz for rendering the diagrams. To solve this issue, follow these steps:

Install Graphviz:

macOS: Use Homebrew to install Graphviz:
Copy code
brew install graphviz
Windows: Download the installer from the Graphviz website and follow the installation instructions.
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): Use the package manager to install Graphviz:
arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install graphviz
Add Graphviz to your system's PATH:

macOS and Linux: Graphviz should be added to your PATH automatically after installation.
Windows:
Find the installation folder for Graphviz (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin).
Add the bin folder to your system's PATH:
Right-click on "My Computer" or "This PC" and choose "Properties".
Click on "Advanced system settings".
Click on "Environment Variables".
Under "System variables", find the variable named "Path" and click "Edit".
Click "New" and add the path to the Graphviz bin folder.
Click "OK" to close all the windows.
After completing these steps, restart your Python environment, and the error should be resolved.
